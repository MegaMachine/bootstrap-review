                      <p>
                        Nike, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that is engaged in the design, development,
                        manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories, and
                        services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area. It is the
                        world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with
                        revenue in excess of US$24.1 billion in its fiscal year 2012 (ending May 31, 2012). As of 2012, it employed
                        more than 44,000 people worldwide. In 2014 the brand alone was valued at $19 billion, making it the most
                        valuable brand among sports businesses. As of 2017, the Nike brand is valued at $29.6 billion. Nike ranked
                        No. 89 in the 2018 Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

                      <p>
                        The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as Blue Ribbon Sports, by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and
                        officially became Nike, Inc. on May 30, 1971. The company takes its name from Nike, the Greek goddess of
                        victory. Nike markets its products under its own brand, as well as Nike Golf, Nike Pro, Nike+, Air Jordan,
                        Nike Blazers, Air Force 1, Nike Dunk, Air Max, Foamposite, Nike Skateboarding, Nike CR7, and subsidiaries
                        including Brand Jordan, Hurley International and Converse. Nike also owned Bauer Hockey (later renamed Nike
                        Bauer) from 1995 to 2008, and previously owned Cole Haan and Umbro. In addition to manufacturing sportswear
                        and equipment, the company operates retail stores under the Niketown name. Nike sponsors many high-profile
                        athletes and sports teams around the world, with the highly recognized trademarks of "Just Do It" and the
                        Swoosh logo.

                      <h3>History</h3>
                      <p>Nike, originally known as Blue Ribbon Sports (BRS), was founded by University of Oregon track athlete Phil
                        Knight and his coach, Bill Bowerman, on January 25, 1964.[11] The company initially operated as a
                        distributor for Japanese shoe maker Onitsuka Tiger, making most sales at track meets out of Knight's
                        automobile.</p>
                      <p>According to Otis Davis, a student athlete whom Bowerman coached at the University of Oregon, who later
                        went on to win two gold medals at the 1960 Summer Olympics, Bowerman made the first pair of Nike shoes for
                        him, contradicting a claim that they were made for Phil Knight. Says Davis, "I told Tom Brokaw that I was
                        the first. I don't care what all the billionaires say. Bill Bowerman made the first pair of shoes for me.
                        People don't believe me. In fact, I didn't like the way they felt on my feet. There was no support and they
                        were too tight. But I saw Bowerman make them from the waffle iron, and they were mine".</p>
                      <p>In 1964, in its first year in business, BRS sold 1,300 pairs of Japanese running shoes grossing $8,000. By
                        1965 the fledgling company had acquired a full-time employee, and sales had reached $20,000. In 1966, BRS
                        opened its first retail store, located at 3107 Pico Boulevard in Santa Monica, California next to a beauty
                        salon, so its employees no longer needed to sell inventory from the back of their cars. In 1967, due to
                        rapidly increasing sales, BRS expanded retail and distribution operations on the East Coast, in Wellesley,
                        Massachusetts.</p>
                      <p>By 1971, the relationship between BRS and Onitsuka Tiger was nearing an end. BRS prepared to launch its
                        own line of footwear, which would bear the Swoosh newly designed by Carolyn Davidson.[15] The Swoosh was
                        first used by Nike on June 18, 1971, and was registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on
                        January 22, 1974.</p>
                      <p>In 1976, the company hired John Brown and Partners, based in Seattle, as its first advertising agency. The
                        following year, the agency created the first "brand ad" for Nike, called "There is no finish line", in
                        which no Nike product was shown. By 1980, Nike had attained a 50% market share in the U.S. athletic shoe
                        market, and the company went public in December of that year.</p>

                      <h3>Acquisitions</h3>
                      <p>Nike has acquired several apparel and footwear companies over the course of its history, some of which
                        have since been sold. Its first acquisition was the upscale footwear company Cole Haan in 1988,[27]
                        followed by the purchase of Bauer Hockey in 1994. In 2002, Nike bought surf apparel company Hurley
                        International from founder Bob Hurley.[28] In 2003, Nike paid US$309 million to acquire Converse, makers of
                        the Chuck Taylor All-Stars line of sneakers.[29] The company acquired Starter in 2004[30] and Umbro, known
                        as the manufacturers of the England national football team's kit, in 2008.</p>
                      <p>In order to refocus on its core business lines, Nike began divesting of some of its subsidiaries in the
                        2000s.[32] It sold Starter in 2007[30] and Bauer Hockey in 2008.[33] The company sold Umbro in 2012 [34]
                        and Cole Haan in 2013.[35] As of 2017, Nike owns two key subsidiaries: Converse Inc. and Hurley
                        International.</p>

                      <h3>Finance</h3>
                      <p>Nike bought back $8 billion of Nike's class B stock in four years after the current $5 billion buyback
                        program was completed in the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. Up to September 2012, Nike Inc. has bought
                        back $10 billion of stock.</p>
                      <p>Nike was made a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average in 2013, when it replaced Alcoa.</p>
                      <p>On December 19, 2013, Nike's quarterly profit rose due to a 13 percent increase in global orders for
                        merchandise since April of that year. Future orders of shoes or clothes for delivery between December and
                        April, rose to $10.4 billion. Nike shares (NKE) rose 0.6 percent to $78.75 in extended trading.</p>
                      <p>In November 2015, Nike announced it would initiate a $12 billion share buyback, as well as a two-for-one
                        stock split, with shares to begin trading at the decreased price on December 24.[41] The split will be the
                        seventh in company history.</p>
                      <p>In June 2018, Nike announced it would initiate a $15 billion share buyback over four years, to begin in
                        2019 upon completion of the previous buyback program.</p>
                      <p>For the fiscal year 2018, Nike reported earnings of US$1.933 billion, with an annual revenue of US$36.397
                        billion, an increase of 6.0% over the previous fiscal cycle. Nike's shares traded at over $72 per share,
                        and its market capitalization was valued at over US$114.5 billion in October 2018.</p>
